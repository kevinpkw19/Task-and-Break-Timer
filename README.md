# Task_and_Break_Timer
Task_and_Break_Timer uses Open-Sourced Libraries by [Lopez Mikhael](https://github.com/lopspower) and [Brendan Vercoelen](https://gist.github.com/bverc) which can be found [here](https://github.com/lopspower/CircularProgressBar) and [here](https://gist.github.com/bverc/1492672) respectively. The app will probably be on the play store soon assuming it passes the review process. Code is a little messy since I just finished it but will clean it up + add comments soon
